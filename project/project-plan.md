# Project Plan

## Title
<!--project a short title. -->
“The Americas” (Projects with relation to North-, Middle- or South-America)

## Main Question

<!-- One main question I want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do economic, environmental, and cultural factors shape the relationships between North, Central, and South America, and what patterns can help support better cooperation in the future?


## Description

<!-- Here try to short describe of my project, I consider writing about why and how I attempt it. -->
The "Americas" project is focused on exploring and understanding key issues that connect North, Central, and South America. With regions so rich in diversity but facing shared challenges, this project addresses how countries across the Americas can work together on topics like climate change,economic, trade, and cultural exchange.

By focusing on these areas, I aim to build a comprehensive understanding of how historical ties and modern developments shape the Americas today.I approach this project by gathering interdisciplinary insights, analyzing case studies, and engaging with local and regional experts.

Ultimately, the project’s goal is to uncover practical strategies for cooperation across the Americas, supporting sustainable growth and unity among these diverse regions for a stronger collective future.

## Datasources

<!-- Here is a list of data sources with brief descriptions, all relevant to achieving the project goals.-->

### Datasource-1: The NCEI has identified nine consistent climate regions across the U.S., focused on tracking anomalies using historical data.(2023 - current)
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeeniye/us-climate-regions
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeeniye/us-climate-regions?select=us_climate_regions.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has identified nine climatically consistent regions across the United States, categorized as North, Central, and South. 
These regions focus on tracking climate anomalies based on historical climate data. Useful for analyzing regional climate trends, comparing climate impacts across different parts of the U.S., and studying localized climate change effects.
It includes various climate attributes for each region, such as temperature, precipitation, and possibly other related environmental indicators.
This dataset could be valuable in environmental research, urban planning, and policy development targeting climate adaptation strategies within the U.S.


### Datasource-2: This dataset contains regional economic information for the U.S., covering North, Central, and South regions based on sales data.(11,2023 - 10,2024)
* Metadata URL:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhabu/us-regional-sales-data
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhabu/us-regional-sales-data?select=US_Regional_Sales_Data.csv
* Data Type: CSV 

This dataset provides detailed economic information across different regions of the United States, segmented into North, Central, and South regions. It includes key metrics such as regional sales, revenue, and volume, offering insights into economic performance by area. By analyzing this data, users can identify trends, high-performing regions, and regional sales patterns. This dataset is valuable for businesses and analysts looking to understand geographic impacts on sales within the U.S.
