## Project Overview
This project is titled **"Unemployment Ratio in the Americas Based on Population Growth (2020–2023)"**, conducted as part of the **Methods of Advanced Data Engineering** course. It provides insights into the interplay between population dynamics and unemployment trends across U.S. states over a three-year period.

### Key Highlights:
- **Population Data**: Utilized data from the U.S. Census Bureau, focusing on annual population estimates for all states (2020–2023).
- **Unemployment Data**: Sourced from the U.S. Department of Labor and Iowa State University, detailing annual unemployment rates.
- **Objective**: To analyze the relationship between rapid population growth and unemployment, with a focus on socio-economic impacts and recovery patterns.

### Methodology:
- **Tools Used**: Python (Jupyter Notebook), Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQLite3.
- **Analysis Focus**:
  1. Trends in population growth and unemployment rates.
  2. State-level economic and demographic impacts.
  3. Visualization of key insights using bar charts and line graphs.

### Findings:
- States like Texas, Florida, and Georgia exhibited resilience with population growth and lower unemployment rates.
- High unemployment rates and cost-of-living challenges were observed in states like New York and California.
- Migration patterns indicate economic shifts toward business-friendly states.
